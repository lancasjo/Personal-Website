                <h2>Euchre game</h2>
                <p> Leveraging expert-level C++ skills, I created an engaging gaming experience for up to four human players, 
                    while integrating a dynamic AI opponent that demonstrates strategic decision-making. 
                    This project highlights a combination of technical acumen, game design acuity, 
                    and a passion for pushing the boundaries of interactive entertainment. 
                    Successfully delivered a polished and immersive game, 
                    exemplifying problem-solving abilities and a commitment to excellence.

                <h2>YouTube Clone</h2>
                <p> Created a dynamic YouTube clone utilizing HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, 
                    showcasing my expertise in front-end web development and user interface design. 
                    Leveraging my comprehensive knowledge of these technologies, 
                    I meticulously crafted a visually stunning and user-friendly platform that 
                    emulates the core functionalities of YouTube. 
                    This project demonstrates my proficiency in HTML, JavaScript, and CSS styling techniques,
                    as well as my ability to implement responsive design principles for optimal viewing across devices. 
                    Through this endeavor, I showcased my passion for creating immersive digital experiences and my 
                    commitment to delivering high-quality, interactive web applications.

                <h2>Route planner</h2>
                <p> Developed an advanced C++ program utilizing 
                    branch and bound algorithms to solve the challenging problem of finding the optimal Hamiltonian cycle 
                    through a given set of locations. Leveraging my expertise in algorithms and data structures, 
                    I meticulously designed and implemented an efficient solution that offers optimal tour paths 
                    for a wide range of scenarios. This project exemplifies my strong analytical skills, 
                    attention to detail, and ability to tackle complex problems in an organized and systematic manner.
                     The successful completion of this endeavor showcases my proficiency in C++ programming, 
                     algorithm optimization, and problem-solving, 
                    making it a valuable asset to any team focused on delivering innovative and efficient solutions.
